## Introduction

Welcome to MinteCalc! This Privacy Policy explains how 3MD FAMILY (PTY) LTD ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information when you use our mobile application MinteCalc (the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the App.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Information You Provide Directly

- **Account Information:** MinteCalc does **not** create user accounts or store any user credentials on our servers. If you upgrade to Pro and choose to use the optional Backup & Restore feature, you may sign in with your Google account. This authentication is handled entirely by Google OAuth—we do not receive, store, or have access to your Google account password or credentials.
- **User Content:** Any data, notes, calculations, or settings you create within the App are stored **locally on your device** (using platform-specific storage: SharedPreferences on Android, UserDefaults on iOS). If you are a Pro user and choose to enable backup, this data is stored in **your own Google Drive account** in a hidden application data folder (`appDataFolder`)—not on our servers.
- **Payment Information:** If you purchase a Pro Upgrade, payment is processed entirely through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not directly collect or store your payment card details.

### 2. Information Collected Automatically

When you use the App, we may automatically collect certain information, including:

- **Device Information:** Device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
- **Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with the App, including features used, session duration, and in-app actions.
- **Crash Reports and Diagnostics:** Technical information about crashes and performance issues to help us improve the App.

### 3. Information We Do NOT Collect

- **Calculation Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your calculations, notes, or results to our servers.
- **Currency Conversion History:** We do not track or store which currencies you convert or the amounts.
- **Note Calculator Data:** Your item names, prices, quantities, and calculations remain entirely on your device (or in your own Google Drive backup if enabled).

### 4. Information Collected by Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services that may collect information:

#### Google Analytics for Firebase
We use Google Analytics for Firebase to understand how users interact with our App. This service may collect:
- App usage patterns and user behavior
- Device and demographic information
- Session and engagement data

For more information, please review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

#### Firebase Crashlytics
We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and diagnostic data to improve App stability. This service collects:
- Crash logs and stack traces
- Device state at the time of crash
- Device identifiers

For more information, please review [Firebase Privacy and Security Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

#### Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore
We use Firebase to deliver currency exchange rate data to the App. Currency rates are updated approximately every hour. This data is fetched from our Firebase database and does not require any personal information from you.

#### ExchangeRate-API
Currency exchange rates displayed in the App are sourced from ExchangeRate-API ([https://www.exchangerate-api.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com)). This service provides the underlying exchange rate data. We do not share any of your personal information with ExchangeRate-API. For more information, please review [ExchangeRate-API's Terms of Use](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/terms).

#### Google AdMob
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements in the App (for non-Pro users). AdMob may collect:
- Advertising identifiers
- Device information
- Location data (if permitted)
- User interaction with advertisements

AdMob may use this information to serve personalized advertisements. For more information about how Google uses your data for advertising, please visit [Google's Advertising Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

**Your Ad Choices:** You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings or by visiting [Google's Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/).

## Google Drive Integration

### Backup and Restore Features

MinteCalc offers the ability to back up and restore your App data using your own Google Drive account. Please note:

- **User Control:** You have full control over your backups. Backup files are stored in your personal Google Drive account, not on our servers.
- **Data Access:** We only access your Google Drive to read from and write to backup files you explicitly create or restore through the App. We do not access any other files in your Google Drive.
- **Authentication:** Google Drive integration requires you to authenticate with your Google account. We do not store your Google account credentials.
- **Data Responsibility:** Since backups are stored in your personal Google Drive, you are responsible for managing and securing your backup files. We are not responsible for any data loss or unauthorized access to your Google Drive account.

For more information about Google Drive's privacy practices, please review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## How We Use Your Information

- **To Improve the App:** Analyzing usage patterns and crash data to enhance performance and user experience.
- **To Process Transactions:** Processing payments for Pro Upgrades (subscriptions and lifetime purchases).

## Pro Upgrade (Subscriptions and Lifetime Purchases)

When you purchase a Pro Upgrade, your payment is processed through the respective app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). We do not directly collect or store your payment card details. Please review the privacy policies of [Apple](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) and [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for information about how they handle payment data.

Pro subscribers enjoy an ad-free experience, and certain data collection related to advertising (AdMob) will not apply to Pro users.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share information in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, advertising).
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.
- **Protection of Rights:** We may disclose information to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or that of our users or the public.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

---

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

---

## Data Retention

Since MinteCalc does not create user accounts or store user data on our servers, data retention works as follows:

- **Local Data (on your device):** Stored indefinitely until you clear the app's storage or uninstall the App.
- **Google Drive Backup (Pro users, optional):** Stored in your personal Google Drive account until you delete it using the "Reset Data & Sign Out" feature in the App, or manually remove it from your Google account.
- **Analytics & Crash Data:** Retained by third-party services (Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics) according to their respective data retention policies. Typically, this data is aggregated and anonymized.

We do not have direct access to delete your local data or Google Drive backup—you have full control over this data.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child, we will take steps to delete such information.
